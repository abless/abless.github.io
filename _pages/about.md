I enjoy building software and am a startup advisor and angel investor. My professional interests largely revolve around Big Data/AI when applied to solving real-world problems. I also enjoy learning more about investing, both in the public and private sector. My happy time is spent in the mountains skiing or mountain biking. I currently reside in Denver, CO.

I joined Palantir in 2013 as a Forward Deployed Engineer. During my time in business development I was closely involved in the early development of Palantir Foundry and last served as the technical lead for Germany, Austria and Switzerland. I then made a switch to product development across a variety of Palantir's offerings. I last worked on AIP, Palantir's offering around LLMs.

Prior to joining Palantir, I went through <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com">YCombinator</a> with <a href="http://www.ardakara.com">Arda Kara</a>. 

I graduated with a MS in CS from Stanford, and a hold a BA in CS from the University of Cambridge.
